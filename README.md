# Gabriel-Mangum-Portfolio

This project was an attempt at creating a portfolio page using various elements that I have learned including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  In the project you can find a page containing information about me, another containing a contact form, and one more with images that I intend on makeing links to my various other projects as I create them.
