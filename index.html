        <p>     I was born in Virginia Beach, VA and lived there until my senior year of Highschool.  I graduated from Grace Academy in Stallings, NC.  After graduation I moved to Washington state on the west coast and became a member of the staff at a volunteer organization known as YWAM.  It was there that I was able to learn a lot about recruiting, admin, some very basic web development, and much more.  I also had the opportunity to travel a lot for work and spent extensive periods of time in Africa and Asia.  After three years of working with the organization I moved back to Charlotte, North Carolina to persue a new carreer.  I spent 2018 getting settled in my new city and began persuing my passion of coding and development in the fall of 2019.</p> <br><br> <br>

        </ul><br>
        <p>I hope to become a part of the team of developers that falls in line with one of my many interests.  Since my time in Washington I have grown to be very passionate about humnaitarian work and would love to see mysefl involved in making a difference in some way with the dev work I intend on doing.</p>
