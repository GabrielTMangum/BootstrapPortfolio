          <p> I was born in Virginia Beach, VA and lived there until my senior year of Highschool. I graduated from
            Grace Academy in Stallings, NC. After graduation I moved to Washington state on the west coast and became a
            member of the staff at a volunteer organization known as YWAM. It was there that I was able to learn a lot
            about recruiting, admin, some very basic web development, and much more. I also had the opportunity to
            travel a lot for work and spent extensive periods of time in Africa and Asia. After three years of working
            with the organization I moved back to Charlotte, North Carolina to persue a new carreer. I spent 2018
            getting settled in my new city and began persuing my passion of coding and development in the fall of 2019.

          <p>I hope to become a part of the team of developers that falls in line with one of my many interests. Since
            my time in Washington I have grown to be very passionate about humnaitarian work and would love to see
            mysefl involved in making a difference in some way with the dev work I intend on doing.</p>
